# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the XEA-web repository.
#
# The submission process checks to make sure that people submitting
# code are listed in this file (by email address).
#
# Names should be added to this file only after verifying that
# the individual or the individual's organization has agreed to
# the appropriate Contributor License Agreement, found here:
#
#     https://gitlab.com/gpul/cla/
#
# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
#     Individual's name <submission email address> <email2> <emailN>
#
# An entry with multiple email addresses specifies that the
# first address should be used in the submit logs and
# that the other addresses should be recognized as the
# same person when interacting with the repository.
# Please keep the list sorted.
